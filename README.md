# StereoCamChArUco

This is a simple toolbox for Stereo Camera calibration using ChArUco board.

Several parts of the code are in fact borrowed from different resources in order to 
make a simple all-in-one tool to do stereo calibration from A to Z.

Comments, pull requests and issue posts are welcomed also any help to make the 3d reconstruction faster and more efficient, although I
did my best to make it as optimised as possible to be able to run on embedded devices like RaspberryPi and Jetson Nano.
